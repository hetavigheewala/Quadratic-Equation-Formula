# Quadratic-Equation-Formula

This program is designed to calculate and display solutions to quadratic equations. It incorporates various 

functions to handle the different aspects of the equation-solving process. The program starts by importing


necessary libraries for input-output and mathematical operations.  It then declares and defines functions 


for various purposes, including calculating the absolute value of an integer, obtaining coefficients for 


the quadratic equation, determining the discriminant, calculating the real and complex components of the


solutions, and handling various printing operations
